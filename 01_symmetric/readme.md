# Symmetric Key
This unit covers the usage of symmetric key, and with a focus on symmetric key methods. With symmetric key, we use the same key to encrypt and to decrypt. 
The most basic mode is ECB, but we can enhance with a salt. A common method which uses salt is 
The main method we use is AES as a block cipher or a stream cipher (GCM).
